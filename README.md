### What it does
**esai** parses through the entire DSM-5 with semantic search. A user can roughly describe how they're feeling - such as "I'm just not having a great day", and **esai** will source both the name of any applicable mental disorders and the DSM-5 reference material, along with diagnostic attributes.

*For physicians*, **esai** will show applicable analytical information about patients - giving it a wide variety of use cases from being a personal mental health aid to an enterprise tool for professionals.

### How we built it

**esai** uses OpenAI's embedding engines, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Pinecone, and Langchain, built on Next.js.
